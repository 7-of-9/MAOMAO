* gamifying the browsing experience: as keywords are pulled out of page text ... points and visual cues for "keywords acrued", aracade style
* acrue simple points for keywords & topics -- compete with friends for mastery of a topic
* NEEDS: very expressive and rich UI overlays 

* single-site suggestion (popup after interacting with page) -> top n pick from background google search or similar
  for interaction sesssion's keywords; don't suggest same site twice to a given user


-- HEURISTICS --

* clicks, scrolls, listens/views & typing -- the number of these should be considered **RELATIVE TO THE AVERAGE FOR THE SITE**
  to really understand how significant the stats are for a given page; this implies that the server needs to maintain this data
  and feed it to clients...

***
* DISCOVERY STRATEGIES : may need to be VERY TAILORED to the source, i.e. specific DISCOVEYR ALGO's based on SOURCE?
  e.g. for youtube hits, the real identity of the youtube channel, e.g. KingCrusher == Tryfon Gavriel == DISCOVERY
       --> from YT view; google search "kingcrusher chess", i.e. username + TOP_WORD_CONTEXT
	   --> from google results: wikipedia.org/User:KingCrusher (3rd hit), so ignoring duplicate hits (YT, 1st and 2nd results)
								twitch.tv/KingCrusher (4th hit)

   BUT [YT Opie and Anthony] the YT posting user is not known enough (e.g. kevyn999)
   strategy here should be (instead) to GS for "Opie and Anthony"; top hits are wikipedia, reddit, opie radio on twitter, etc.

   SO key point is really to find the CORRECT google search terms; maybe need to make multiple background GS and try to discern
   the most relevent? this, combined with deep 

   CONCLUSION: *focus* on YouTube initially... the heuristics & discovery mechanisms must SURELY be extremely specific to
			  not only the source (YT) but also the "dynamics" of the source session page, e.g. KingCrusher vs. kevyn999
			  AND will almost certainly involve heavy text procesing & analytics of the source session page...
